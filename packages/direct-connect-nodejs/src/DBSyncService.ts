   * The `seqEnd` of the prior msg is just the largest dbversion & seq in the `changes` array.

   * If a single DB opens many sync connections to the server we can end up with out of order delivery.

   * A few ways to solve this:
   * 1. Require the client to manage a contiguous stream and have the server just apply.
   * 2. Have the server throw and say from which version to restart
   * 3. Have the client only create one sync connection to the server for the same client DB.
   *
   * Pt 3 would need to be done via a shared worker or leader election.
